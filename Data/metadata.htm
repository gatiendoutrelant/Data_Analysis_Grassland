<hr>
  <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Large scale surveys on  environmental gradients proven to be valuable to formulate and test hypotheses (e.g., Manel et al. 2000; Kleinebecker et al. 2008; Maskell et al. 2010). Data from such surveys provide a means of assessing  actual impacts of global change drivers, testing of models at a large scale, and providing insights into regional biodiversity patterns (Manel et al. 2000).</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This data paper documents the species composition and soil and plant tissue biogeochemistry of 153 acid grasslands in the Atlantic biogeographic region of Europe. Grasslands surveyed belonged to the alliance <i>Violion caninae</i> (Schwickerath 1944) and are typically grass dominated, with <i>Agrostis capillaris</i> L. and<i> Festuca ovina sensu lato</i> L. being most common and abundant. Sedge, rush, shrub and forb cover is  variable, common species include <i>Luzula  campestris</i> (L.) DC., <i>Potentilla  erecta</i> (L.) Räuschel and <i>Galium  saxatile</i> L. Bryophytes are commonly found in the grassland sward, particularly in the UK, with the species most frequently found being <i>Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus</i>. Grasslands  were sampled in 10 countries including Ireland, Isle of Man, Great Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden. The acidic grasslands visited were selected in  a stratified manner to cover the range of atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in north-western Europe, and sites in the vicinity of local point sources of N (e.g., large pig or poultry farms up to 1 km away) were avoided. All of the grasslands were managed by grazing or cutting and none were fertilized. Areas within the grassland that belonged to other plant communities or were strongly affected by animals (e.g., stock feeding areas), tracks and paths, or were in the rain shadows of trees or hedges were excluded from the survey. At each site five randomly placed replicate 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 m quadrats were sampled within a 1 ha sampling area. Within each quadrat, all vascular plants and bryophytes were identified to species level and their cover was estimated. A total of 397 species were found in the 153 sites (335 species of vascular plant and 62 species of bryophyte). Two topsoil samples were collected from each quadrat at a depth of 0–10 cm below the litter layer and bulked to make one sample per quadrat. Subsoil samples were collected from the centre of the quadrat from a depth of 20 – 30 cm or, in shallower soils, as deep as was possible. Soils were analyzed for pH in water, metal concentrations, nitrate and ammonium concentrations, total carbon and N, and Olsen extractable phosphorus. Aboveground plant tissues were collected from within the 1 ha sampling  area for three species: <i>Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, Galium saxatile </i>and <i>Agrostis capillaris </i>and analyzed for percentage N, carbon and phosphorus. Site physical characteristics, including location, altitude, aspect and slope, are also collated.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">This data set (or parts thereof) has already been used to publish a number of research papers focusing on the effects of N deposition on the species composition and biogeochemistry of grasslands (Stevens et al<i>.</i> 2004; Stevens et al<i>.</i> 2006; Fraser and Stevens 2008;  Stevens et al. 2009<i>a</i>; Stevens et al<i>.</i> 2009<i>b</i>; Duprè et al<i>.</i> 2010; Stevens et al<i>.</i> 2010<i>a</i>; Stevens et al<i>.</i> 2010<i>b</i>; Stevens et al. <i>in press</i>-a; Stevens et al<i>.</i> <i>in press</i>-b). However, the sampling of a well-defined habitat across a large spatial scale and the methodological consistency of the data also provide unique opportunities to investigate spatial and biogeographic  patterns further.</font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Abstract:</b> This data set consists of vascular plant and bryophyte species composition and plant and soil  biogeochemical data from 153 acid grasslands located in the Atlantic biogeographic region of Europe. Data were collected between 2002 and 2007. The grasslands all belong to the <i>Violion caninae </i>association and were managed by grazing or cutting but had not received fertilizer inputs. These data provide plant composition from five randomly located 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 m quadrats at each site with all vascular plants and bryophytes identified to species level with cover estimates for each species. Topsoil and subsoil were collected in each quadrat, and data are provided for pH, metal concentrations, nitrate and ammonium concentrations, total carbon and N, and Olsen extractable phosphorus. Aboveground plant tissues were collected for three species (<i>Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, Galium saxatile, </i>and <i>Agrostis  capillaris</i>), and data are provided for percentage N, carbon, and phosphorus. These data have already been used in a number of research papers focusing on the impacts of atmospheric N deposition on grassland plant community and biogeochemistry. The unique data set presented  here provides the opportunity to test theories about the effect of environmental variation on plant communities, biogeochemistry, and plant–soil interactions, as well as spatial ecology and biogeography. </font></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">2. Sampling design  </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Design characteristics: </b>Sites were selected in a stratified manner to cover the range of ambient N deposition in Europe and climatic gradients. Where possible grasslands surveyed were selected at random from national data sets of grassland extent or protected sites held by conservation agencies although in a number of regions the limited number of grasslands and sampling restrictions meant that this was not possible. This was particularly true in Norway, Sweden, Denmark, and Germany.</font></p>
  <p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Data collection: </font></b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One hundred and fifty three <i>Violion caninae</i> grasslands were surveyed. To ensure consistent community  selection across the geographic gradient, a list of indicative or dominant species of the community was drawn up of which at least five had to be present at each of the survey sites. These were all species which typically have a high constancy in the community and/or occur at cover greater than 20%. The indicative or dominant species used for site selection were: <i>Festuca rubra/ovina </i>aggregates, <i>Agrostis capillaris, Galium saxatile, Potentilla erecta, Luzula campestris, Danthonia spp, Deschampsia  flexuosa, Nardus stricta, Polygala spp., Calluna vulgaris, Carex pilulifera, Campanula rotundifolia, Rhytidiadelphus squarrous</i>. Five randomly located 2&nbsp;×&nbsp;2 m quadrats  were surveyed within a 1 ha area. Areas within the grassland that belonged to other plant communities or were strongly  affected by animals, tracks and paths, or were in the rain shadows of trees or  hedges were avoided. Within each quadrat, all vascular plants and  bryophytes were identified to a species level and their cover was estimated using the Domin scale (see Table 2). Cover estimates were made by a total of four different surveyors so the Domin scale was used to minimise error between surveyors. A description of the site was made and data collected on latitude, longitude, aspect, slope, vegetation height (visual estimate of mean height across the site), and soil depth (to  bedrock). Management type was recorded and management intensity was estimated based on a visual estimate of vegetation height and the presence of animals. Topsoil samples were taken from the top 10 cm below the litter layer. Samples were taken from two opposing corners of the quadrat, bulked to one sample per quadrat. Ten centimeter depth subsoil samples were taken at a depth of 20–30 cm (or as deep as possible if the soil depth was &lt; 30 cm) from the center of the quadrat using a 5 cm diameter soil auger. Above-ground plant tissue samples were  collected from within the vicinity of the quadrats for three species <i>Agrostis capillaris</i> L. (bent grass), <i>Galium saxatile</i> L. (lady’s bedstraw) and the moss <i>Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus</i> (Hedw.) Warnst. These species were selected because they represent the most common and abundant grass, forb and bryophyte in the community. Where values are not provided in the data tables the species was not present on the site. Plant tissue samples were washed in deionized water and gently dried with paper towels within 24 hours of collection. Samples were then stored for up to one week before they were dried in the laboratory. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">3. Research Methods</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><b>Laboratory:</b> Soil samples were air dried, roots and stones removed and remaining soil ground to &lt;2 mm using a pestle and mortar. For total carbon (C) and N analysis, soils were ground to a fine powder using a ball mill. Plant samples were oven dried for three days at 55 ºC and then ground to &lt; 2 mm using a ball  mill or mechanical grinder.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Nitrate, ammonium, dissolved calcium (Ca), aluminium (Al), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg),  manganese (Mn) and Zinc (Zn) concentrations were analyzed using two different methods. Samples collected in 2002 and 2003 were leached with 1 M KCl and the resulting nitrate and ammonium analyzed using an ion chromatograph. Other  amples were shaken with 0.4 M NaCl and analyzed using an auto-analyzer. For all samples metal concentrations were determined using an ICP-MS or ICP-OES. An Olsen extraction was used to estimate plant-available P (MAFF, 1986). Absorbance was determined using a colorimeter at a wavelength of 880nm. Total C and N content of the soil and plant material was analyzed using a CN elemental analyzer. All analysis was conducted on dry soil as it was not possible to perform extractions immediately on return to the laboratory (Robertson et al. 1999). Plant tissue phosphorus (P) concentration was determined using a dry ashing extraction method (Chapman and Pratt, 1985; Ryan et al.<i>,</i> 2001) followed by a Barton colour complex (MAFF, 1986). Absorbance  was determined using a colorimeter at a wavelength of 410 nm. Soil pH was determined using a pH probe in a 1:5 slurry of soil and deionized water.</font></p>
